# font-baseline
Font family "Baseline", a series of fonts in which the glyphs are drawn with a single connecting line, connecting at the baseline.  
The family currently includes _Square_ and _Hand_ variants.

# Baseline Square
This font was inspired by Baseline Hand, which I started but only made letters a to g before this squared idea came to mind.  

At present, it is just a simple brushed-stroke version, but I envís̈âg̃e a sharper, pointier version in the future.
The font has full support for my custom alphabet and orthography for modern English, dubbed NewEng.  

It doesn't yet have any punctuation or symbol glyphs, numbers, nor any uppercase letters. I'll get around to those soon. (I made this in a hurry, on a whim, in the middle of another job, because it came to mind and I had to exorcise it immediately so I didn't lose it. Hence, it has sat incomplete since that day!)

# Baseline Hand
This was the original font idea which I started but realised would take quite a while to create well, as implementing the connecting lines cleanly would be challenging (especially as FontLab 8's _Brush_ tool is remarkably badly designed. Hence, I chose to follow my next inspiration in order to simply get the concept recorded, which was to make the lines follow a squarer grid, giving rise to _Baseline Square_.  

Currently, this font only includes letters a to g, and is nowhere near ready for being used! However, if you would like to use it, please drop a comment or message me and I'll start working on it again.
